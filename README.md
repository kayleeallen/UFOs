# UFOs

## Overview
For this challenge, we had to create an HTML page using javascript and css to upload a javascript data file into a database. We added filters to parse through the large dataset.

## Results
When the user accesses the web page, the first item they will see is the header and a description of the website and data.

Below the introduction to the site, the user will see a database filled with information regarding various UFO sightings across the US. Because of the large amount of data, we added filters on the left-hand side so the user can search through the data using various criteria.

For example, here I filtered the dataset to only view results from Michigan, my home state:

## Summary
Overall, the layout of the webpage is clean and easy to read. One drawback to the design, however, is that you don't have the option to sort the data. For further development, I woul recommend adding the ability to sort the columns - for example: sort by date from most to least recent. Additionally, I would make the paragraph description below the header collapsable to reduce clutter.
